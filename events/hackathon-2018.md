#### OpenCDC Hackathon: Oct. 3rd + 4th
![OpenCDC Hackathon October 3rd and 4th 2018][hackathon-banner]

Registration is now available for the OpenCDC Hackathon scheduled for October 3–4, 2018, and co-sponsored by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and the Division of Health Informatics and Surveillance (DHIS) in the Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services (CSELS). Hosted by the Accelerator Team (XLR) in DHIS, the hackathon is open to all CDC employees, including FTEs, contractors, and fellows, interested in open source technologies, innovation, and collaboration at CDC.
 
During the hackathon, participants from across CDC will engage in collaborative computer programming to solve one of five identified challenges that the agency has or is likely to encounter. To solve the hackathon challenges, participants will use modern technology available to CDC personnel such as the Open Shift platform, Docker, MongoDB, and microservices.
 
Organizers planned the hackathon to increase participants’ awareness of tools and technologies available to CDC employees, help participants gain hands-on experience using these new tools, promote cross-CIO collaborations and relationships, and create new code or solutions that could be immediately put into practice to solve real business needs at CDC.
 
To register, please complete the form at [https://go.usa.gov/xUfPG](https://go.usa.gov/xUfPG) by October 1, 2018.  The hackathon will be located at the CDC Roybal Campus, Building 19, Auditorium B1/B2.
